Pursuing peace through women's participation
The Administration of President Barack Obama believes that 
Women are crucial to ending conflict and building lasting security 
A growing body of evidence shows 
How women around the world contribute to making and keeping the peace 
And that these contributions lead to better outcomes for entire societies 
We have enough anecdotal evidence and research that demonstrates women in peacekeeping 
is both the right thing to do and the smart thing as well 
It's right 
Because after all women are affected by conflict 
They deserve to participate in the decisions that shape their own lives 
And it's the smart thing 
Because we have seen again and again that women participating in these processes build more durable peace 
Hundreds of peace treaties have been signed in the past 20 or so years 
But a sampling of those treaties shows only 3 of the signatories were women 
So President Obama recently launched the first-ever U S National Action Plan on Women's Peace and Security 
Which will accelerate and institutionalize efforts across the United States government to advance women's participation in making and keeping the peace.
